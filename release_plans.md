## Releases

Releases of DSBench will be linked from [DataStax Labs Downloads](https://downloads.datastax.com/#labs) to releases in this repository.

This is a description of our strategy for balancing the scope of each release: Each one will be themed around a major improvement for user experience. When needed, a release will also include an internal improvement for technical debt. Bug-fixes or small enhancements will also be included, based on user feedback and bug reports, as well as improvements in the user guide for casual and advanced users.

These are indicated by labels in the issue tracker:
- `UX` for use experience - up to 1 per milestone - basis for the milestone theme
- `TECH` for tech debt - up to 1 per milestone
- `documentation` for docs focus - part of the theme
- `bug` tickets - as needed

The theme of each release will be described clearly in the milestone. If there is a ramp in bugs that need fixed, we may opt to do a quality-only release to fix things on a case-by-case basis befor returning to themed releases.

More details on the plans for each release can be seen on the [DSBench Milestones](https://github.com/datastax/dsbench-labs/milestones) plan. These milestones are subject to change, but we will do our best to stick to the ones which have been decided.
