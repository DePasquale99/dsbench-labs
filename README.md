# WORK IN PROGRESS

This repo will remain private until the relase of dsbench on the labs download site. At that time, it will be made public.


# DSBench

This repository is the community hub for DSBench, a testing tool that
offers simple and powerful benchmarking for CQL Databases. DSBench is a
tailored version of one of the tools used by DataStax for internal testing as well as workload characterization with some of our clients.

# Releases

Releases of DSBench will be linked from [DataStax Labs Downloads](https://downloads.datastax.com/#labs) to releases in this repository.

DSBench development is sponsored by DataStax, _insert blurb here_.

## Support

DSBench is released through DataStax labs. It is supported by a community
of active users at [DataStax DSBench Community](https://community.datastax.com/dsbench/index.html).

If you think you have found a bug, you may [file a bug report](https://github.com/datastax/dsbench-labs/issues/new?labels=bug). DSBench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources permit.
