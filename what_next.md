# What Next?

There are many ways to use dsbench, depending on your level of need.

As we navigate sharing this toolkit with our broader user community, we'll need to lean on each other to identify where more polish is needed and what features are most in demand.

## For Everyone

We're working hard on bringing the next version of DSBench to you. The focal point on the next release will be clearly identified as a milestone at the [DSBench Milestones](https://github.com/datastax/dsbench-labs/milestones) page.

If you are interested in helping out, one of the best ways to do so is to share in our [DataStax DSBench Community](https://community.datastax.com/spaces/51/index.html) and on our [DSBench Issues](https://github.com/datastax/dsbench-labs/issues) page.

## For Workload Builders

If you want to know how to build a workload from scratch to emulate the access patterns of an application, the next release of dsbench will be for you! We're just getting started, so hang in there while we get more docs in place.

## The Future

To get an idea for what we are planning to do with DSBench going forward, here are some of our big ideas:

1. UIs. The Guidebook is really just an app. We'll bring more UIs to support workload construction, bindings testing, and so on.
2. Mac and Windows support.
3. Additional Docs
4. Additional Activity types, such as TCP, other protocols
5. Improved Metrics
6. Improved Logging
7. Scripting Enhancements
